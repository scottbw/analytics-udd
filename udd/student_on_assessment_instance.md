## Description of student_on_assessment_instance entity
A student_on_assessment_instance describes a student's performance on a specific assessment.

## STUDENT_ON_ASSESSMENT_INSTANCE_ID
### Description
Primary key. Where not supplied by data provider, the primary key will be generated by the LRW loading mechanism.

### Purpose
Enables easy reference to student_on_assessment_instance.

### Derivation
Jisc

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
Where not supplied by data provider, the primary key will be generated by the LRW loading mechanism.

## ASSESS_SEQ_ID
### Description
A unique sequence number to indicate the order of assessment opportunities afforded to a student against the assessment indicated by assess_instance_id. These assessment opportunities might be referred to as "attempts" at an assessment, but should include all assessment opportunities, even if they were not in fact made, owing to illness for example.

### Purpose
To identify the latest assessment opportunity afforded to a student, regardless of whether or not results were achieved, especially for those being reassessed. Each assessment opportunity should have a unique student_on_assessment_instance record, regardless of mitigating circumstances or results.

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Any

### Format
Int

### Notes
The ASSESS_SEQ_ID number should be incremented in line with the chronological order of assessment opportunities afforded to the student in respect of the specified assessment. The first assessment opportunity would have ASSESS_SEQ_ID = 1.
This property relates to the number of times a student has taken, or had the opportunity to take, an assessment, not the sequence of all the assessments on a module.


## ASSESS_DUE_DATE
### Description
The date an assessment instance for a student was due for submission.

### Purpose
Analytics and display

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Date in ISO 8601 format - YYYY-MM-DD

### Format
String in ISO 8601 Date extended format - YYYY-MM-DD

### Notes


## ASSESS_SUBMISSION_DATE
### Description
The date an assessment or assignment was submitted by the student.

### Purpose
Analytics and display

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Date in ISO 8601 format - YYYY-MM-DD

### Format
String in ISO 8601 Date extended format - YYYY-MM-DD

### Notes


## ASSESS_RETAKE
### Description
States whether this is a retake of the assessment for that student as a result of mitigating circumstances.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
<table>
<tr><td>ASSESS_RETAKE</td><td>DESCRIPTION(ENGLISH)</td><td>DESCRIPTION(WELSH)  </td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Yes</td><td>Ie  </td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>No</td><td>Na</td></tr>
</table>  

### Format
String (255)

### Notes


## ASSESS_ACTUAL_MARK
### Description
The mark, expressed as a percentage, awarded to the learner after any moderation process, but before any formal confirmation process. Moderation processes typically involve multiple markers, and confirmation processes typically involve external examiners.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
0-100

### Format
Decimal

### Notes
ASSESS_ACTUAL_MARK should only be part of a UDD compliant dataset if there is a moderation process and if the result of that process is available in the source data.
The value represents a percentage; for example, a value of "63.75" means 63.75%, a value of "50" means 50%.


## ASSESS_AGREED_MARK
### Description
The mark, expressed as a percentage, recorded after any moderation or confirmation processes, or the only recorded mark if there are no moderation or confirmation processes.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
0-100

### Format
Decimal

### Notes
ASSESS_AGREED_MARK is expected to be present in any UDD compliant dataset as soon as it becomes available.
The value represents a percentage; for example, a value of "63.75" means 63.75%, a value of "50" means 50%.


## ASSESS_RAW_ACTUAL_MARK
### Description
The original mark scored by the student.

### Purpose
Storage of the original numerical score, typically from the VLE.

### Derivation
Institution

### Valid Values
Any decimal value

### Format
Decimal

### Notes
Can contain any decimal value, for example "59", "162.87", and so on; this value may or may not be a percentage. ASSESS_ACTUAL_MARK contains a representation of ASSESS_RAW_ACTUAL_MARK explicitly as a percentage.


## ASSESS_RAW_AGREED_MARK
### Description
The mark scored by the student after any moderation or confirmation processes, or the only recorded mark if there are no moderation or confirmation processes.

### Purpose
Storage of the numerical score, typically as recorded in the student record system.

### Derivation
Institution

### Valid Values
Any decimal value

### Format
Decimal

### Notes
Can contain any decimal value, for example "59", "162.87", and so on; this value may or may not be a percentage. ASSESS_AGREED_MARK contains a representation of ASSESS_RAW_AGREED_MARK explicitly as a percentage.


## ASSESS_ACTUAL_GRADE
### Description
The grade awarded to the learner after any moderation process, but before any formal confirmation process. Moderation processes typically involve multiple markers, and confirmation processes typically involve external examiners.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Any

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
ASSESS_ACTUAL_GRADE should only be part of a UDD compliant dataset if there is a moderation process and if the result of that process is available in the source data.


## ASSESS_AGREED_GRADE
### Description.
The grade recorded after any moderation or confirmation processes, or the only recorded grade if there are no moderation or confirmation processes. 

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Any

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
ASSESS_AGREED_GRADE is expected to be present in any UDD compliant dataset as soon as it becomes available.


## ASSESSMENT_CURRENT_ATTEMPT
### Description
Number of attempts taken by a student so far on an assessment instance, that are recognised by the institution as separate attempts.

### Purpose
Enables an institution to record the number of attempts a student has made, including the current attempt, that are officially recognised by the institution as attempts at the assessment. See Notes.
ASSESSMENT_CURRENT_ATTEMPT differs from ASSESS_SEQ_ID, which identifies all assessment opportunities, whether actually taken or not, and regardless of mitigating circumstances.

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Any

### Format
Int

### Notes
Some institutions' regulations penalise a student's second attempt under normal circumstances. Mitigating circumstances might allow a student to have an additional assessment opportunity without penalty; in which case ASSESS_CURRENT_ATTEMPT would remain as 1, with ASSESS_SEQ_ID differentiating the first and second opportunities.
Omitting this property may hinder the development or use of an effective analytics model.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc; student_on_a_module_instance.MOD_RESULT

<table>
<tr><td>ASSESSMENT_RESULT</td><td>DESCRIPTION(ENGLISH)</td><td>DESCRIPTION(WELSH)  </td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Pass</td><td>  </td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fail</td><td>  </td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Not known</td><td> </td></tr>
</table>  

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
Code 3 is applied in all cases where the outcome is either not known (yet), or doesn't apply because the student hasn't been assessed yet. 
Omitting this property could impair the functionality of analytics applications such as student apps or dashboards.


## GRADE_DATE
### Description
The date at which the grade result has been confirmed and awarded.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Date in ISO 8601 format - YYYY-MM-DD

### Format
String in ISO 8601 Date extended format - YYYY-MM-DD

### Notes
This is the date when a grade has been moderated and agreed, but before exam board confirmation. It is typically the date at which the grade is entered in a SRS.


## MAX_POINTS
### Description
The maximum points that an instructor can allocate to an assessment. Used to indicate the marking scale used for an assignment.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Any decimal value

### Format
Decimal

### Notes
This property can contain any decimal value. It will normally be an integer representing the highest mark obtainable.


## X_ASSESS_DETAIL
